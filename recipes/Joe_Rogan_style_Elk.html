    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>

    <p>I’ve always been a huge fan of meat. Chicken wings, steaks, buttered salmon, baby back ribs, bacon. You name it, I love it. And as an avid listener to the JRE Podcast – I got to thinking, why is Joe Rogan so enthusiastically in love with eating elk?</p>

    <p>Joe Rogan loves elk meat because it’s delicious, tender, and not very gamey flavor. He kills most of the elk himself, although he does sometimes eat elk that friends hunted and gave to him. The elk he eats is all wild, organic, healthy, lean and low in fat, and hormone, steroid, and antibiotic free.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Elk Roast or Steak</li>
        <li>Pink Himalayan Sea Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Powder</li>
        <li>Saskatchewan rub by Traeger (optional)</li>
        <li>Diced Garlic</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Grass Fed butter or Beef Tallow</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Sason</p> <p>Season with blackened Saskatchewan rub by Traeger grills, or go simple with just pink Himalayan sea salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Joe plays around with seasoning. It’s more of an art than a science.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook</p><p>Cook with outdoor pellet grill at 225 degrees Fahrenheit. Low and slow, baby. He cooks elk with a Traeger pellet grill and is a big fan of the pellets because they contain “no bullshit.” To make the pellets, companies take sawdust from saw mills and compact it down tight until the pellets are formed. It contains nothing but compressed wood. That meaning no chemicals, no lighter fluid, and no gas. Joe describes it best: “just wood, fire and meat!”</p></li>
        <li><p>Sear</p><p>After your meat reaches about 125 internal temperature, sear it on very hot cast iron frying pan, using beef tallow or grass-fed butter for oil.Have your cast iron frying pan set to HIGH and put grass fed butter, garlic and thyme in the pan when transferring the meat.
        “I sear the shit out of it with some garlic, thyme, flip it over get that good sear on all sides.” – Joe Rogan
        Take it off when you get a nice dark sear on all sides before it burns (about 30 sec to 1 minute on each side.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Let it rest and slice</p><p>Let it rest 10 minutes to lock in flavor and juices.“And then let it sit for minimum of 10 minutes and then I slice that mother f***er.” – Joe Rogan</p></li>
    </ol>
